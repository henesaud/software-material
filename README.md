# Useful links about Software


## Learning
Traditional institutions' teaching methods are horrible (at least in Brazil). 
To learn about the science of learning, start with this paper: [Teaching the science of learning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321667981_Teaching_the_science_of_learning). A good Youtube channel for learning how to learn is [Scott Young](https://www.youtube.com/@ScottHYoungVid).

## Clean Code and good practices
Clean Code from Uncle Bob should be considered but with some caveats. This post has arguments to [stop recommending this book](https://qntm.org/clean), but you can still use much of the knowledge there. Some people suggest an alternative book, A Philosophy of Software Design,
although this book writes about more general high-level subjects. 

[This repository](https://github.com/google/eng-practices) contains good engineering practices from Google.


## Design Patterns
Head First Design Patterns is a good introduction to this subject. It explains the patterns in a funny and intelligible way. Another excellent book is, of course, Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.

## Programming languages
### Go
The Go Programming Language is a good book if you know how to program. 
To write effective Go, visit [this link](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go).

The best course I have found is, by far, [Go Class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDQAZEJK8lI&list=PLoILbKo9rG3skRCj37Kn5Zj803hhiuRK6).

[This Link](https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining/tree/master/reading#interviews) contains useful material for Go and software in general. 

If you want to use Port & Adaptors (a.k.a hexagonal) architecture, [this link](https://jmgarridopaz.github.io/content/hexagonalarchitecture.html) has a good explanation about it.

The [Uber Guide](https://github.com/uber-go/guide) contains an excellent guide on writing go code. 

## Computer Architecture & OS & Network
Here are some important material about these subjects:
