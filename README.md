Tips on books and videos that I have consumed.


## Learning
Traditional institutions' teaching methods are horrible (at least in Brazil). 
Learn about the science of learning. You can start with this paper: [Teaching the science of learning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321667981_Teaching_the_science_of_learning) A good Youtube channel for learning is [Scott Young](https://www.youtube.com/@ScottHYoungVid).

Clean Code from Uncle Bob should be considered but with some caveats. This post has arguments to [stop recommending this book](https://qntm.org/clean), but I think you can still use much of the knowledge there. Some people suggest an alternative book, A Philosophy of Software Design,
although this book writes about more general high-level subjects.
